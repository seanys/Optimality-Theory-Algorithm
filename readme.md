## Introduction

This repository contains four algorithms intoduced in Prof. Liang Zhe's Optimization Theory. 

I consult some other repositories and run them successfully in Python. Besides, I also apply them to solve Cutting and Packing Problem and Multi Commodity Network Flow Problem.



## Algorithm

### Column Generation



### DW Decomposition



### Bender Decomposition



## Problems

### Cutting and Packing Problem

Column Generation



### Multi Commodity Network Flow Problem
