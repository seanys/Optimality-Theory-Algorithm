## Introduction

This repository contains three algorithms intoduced in Prof. Liang Zhe's Optimization Theory.

We mainly consult [XpressOptimization](https://www.fico.com/fico-xpress-optimization/docs/latest/examples/python/GUID-E77AC35C-9488-3F0A-98B4-7F5FD81AFF1D.html)'s python examples and we simply introduce our modification. 

Besides, we also apply them to solve Cutting and Packing Problem and Multi Commodity Network Flow Problem. [Algorithms-and-Problems](algorithms-and-problems)

## XPress

### Official

> FICO® Xpress Optimization is integrated into the FICO® Decision Management Suite and is comprised of four components:
>
> 1. FICO® Xpress Insight enables businesses to rapidly deploy optimization models as powerful applications.
> 2. FICO® Xpress Executor provides standalone support for optimization execution services.
> 3. FICO® Xpress Solver provides optimization algorithms and technologies to solve linear, mixed integer and non-linear problems.
> 4. FICO® Xpress Workbench is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for developing optimization models, services and complete solutions.
