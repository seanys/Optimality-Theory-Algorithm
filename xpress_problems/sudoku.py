# Example using the Xpress Python interface
#
# Sudoku: place numbers from 1 to 9 into a 9x9 grid such that no
# number repeats in any row, in any column, and in any 3x3 sub-grid.
#
# More generally, replace 3 with q and 9 with q^2

# We model this problem as an assignment problem where certain
# conditions must be met for all numbers in the columns, rows, and
# sub-grids.
#
# These subgrids are lists of tuples with the coordinates of each
# subgrid. In a 9x9 sudoku, for instance, subgrids[0,1] has the 9
# elements in the top square, i.e., the following:
#
#  ___ ___ ___
# |   |###|   |
# |   |###|   |
# |___|###|___|
# |   |   |   |
# |   |   |   |
# |___|___|___|
# |   |   |   |
# |   |   |   |
# |___|___|___|
#
# while subgrids[2,2] has the 9 elements in the bottom right square.

# The input is a starting grid where the unknown numbers are replaced by zero
