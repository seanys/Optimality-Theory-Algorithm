#### We define the following functions:
#### - subproblem: function that solves the subproblem for a given first stage
####   variable xhat. If the subproblem has an optimal solution, it returns the
####   the optimal dual multiplier associated with the non anticipativaty
####   constraint, the optimal objective, and the label "Optimal". If the
####   subproblem is infeasible, it returns the dual ray of unboundedness and
####   the label "Infeasible".
#### - integer_callback: An integer callback is triggered every time an integer
####   solution is found. The function integer_callback is an input to the
####   addcbpreintsol function and has a specified input - output format based
####   on the Xpress documentation. It takes as input the master optimization
####   problem name, a user data structure, a variable that indicates whether
####   the integer solution comes from a heuristic or from a node relaxation,
####   and the proposed update to the upper bound if this integer solution is
####   accepted as feasible. The inputs are populated by the solver when the
####   callback is triggered. The function returns whether the integer solution
####   found should be accepted as feasible and the proposed update to the upper
####   bound if the solution is feasible (which could be the same as the one
####   proposed by the solver as part of the input.)

################################################################################
#### Subproblem Solver Function
def subproblem(xhat):
    # Input
    # - xhat: n1x1a array is the first stage variable,
    # passed to the subproblem
    #
    # Output:
    # return (lamb: n1x1 array, beta: scalar, flag:string)
    # - If the subproblem is Infeasible, the flag is 'Infeasible', and
    #   lamb (n1x1) and beta (1x1) are the components of the dual ray of
    #   unboundedness necessary to write a feasibility cut of the form:
    #       sum(x[i]*lamb[i] for all i) +beta >= 0
    # - If the subproblem is Optimal, the flag is 'Optimal', beta (1x1) is the
    #   optimal objective, and lamb (n1x1) is the optimal dual multiplier
    #   associated with the non anticipativaty constraint, so that the
    #   optimality cut will have the form:
    #       theta >= sum(x[i]*lamb[i] for all i) + beta

    # IMPORTANT NOTE: The subproblem needs to ensure tha upper bounds or non
    # zero lower bounds should ONLY BE DEFINED THROUGH CONSTRAINTS, not as part
    # of the variable definition. This is to ensure the feasibility cuts are
    # correct.
    # Side Note: It is a good practice to ensure that the subproblem is always
    # feasible through modeling, by say adding slacks to all the constraints,
    # hence avoiding feasibility cuts completely. This is because feasibility
    # cuts tend to be extremely slow. In this code we implemented feasibility
    # cuts for reasons of completeness.
